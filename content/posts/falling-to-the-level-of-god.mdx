> If you aim for Google’s standard, which is sky high, even if you fall, you are still in the clouds. But if you’re aiming for the trees, you’re going to fall to the ground.

I recently discovered these words from one of my mentors from my past journals, and I want to keep them in my head for years to come.

My goal is aiming sky high; I frankly want to be a world-class engineer, MAANG level worthy. It’s great if I can be employed in their amazing environment, but I’ve realized it’s not my final destination.

Nowadays, I treat goals as a direction, not a destination. Think like “Where do you want to go?” That way, goals can naturally change as time goes by, as things change and become more important to us. 

Of course, I’m not planning to fail. In fact, I don’t know how the journey will play out, but if I look at it through first principles, my core desire is to be beneficial. I want to serve people. It’s not merely a dream; I believe in my core identity as a lifelong learner. I have to endlessly reinvent myself by growing and growing again. I always know there’s something I can learn out there.

I said before that a goal is only a direction; what matters more than the goals is the **meta goals**. It is the “identity” of the person you want to become. Meta goals are transferable, so if your goals are changing, the identity will continue to support your ever-changing goals. Nonetheless, it’s not tied to the outcome, which is an external variable that we can’t control. Becoming the kind of person you want to become is purely an internal variable that we *can* control.

Think about your goals: what kind of person would probably achieve these kinds of goals? Work towards that, then let the universe (or luck) work. It’s okay if your goal isn’t being achieved; _**at least you’re going in the right direction.**_ There’s always another way to make an impact. Goal is not absolute. I’m glad that in my early 20s I failed often and faster. I do reflect a lot and learn from my past failures. But if I speak more philosophically, I believe you’re only failing if you stop trying.

Then let’s talk about a system. I like to put it as **Save Yourself Some Time, Energy, and Money (SYSTEM)**. It’s an acronym coined by Dan Martell. Many people think routines are boring, which I used to believe too. But routines and habits shape the identity of a person you want to become without relying on pure willpower. In the long term, habits and routines will compound, and surely the **_probability of us achieving our goals will be increased._** In other words, **a system is the way to achieve your meta goals.**

There’s a famous quote by James Clear in *Atomic Habits*:

> You don’t rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your system

But let’s twist it. **What if your system is God?** Then the quote turns into:

> *You don’t rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of God*

Actually, I’m not really a religious person. But I believe in a creator. There must be a reason why the world exists. If the world contains vast energy today, that energy must have had an origin. It means that if the world exists, there must be someone more powerful than a human that can produce the result. It's enough reason for me to believe that God does exist. And if that same powerful being backed you up on your journey, guess where would you go? Since the world is simply small to Him, you can definitely go endless. That’s my theory.

Now, to put it simply, let’s think of it this way. Since I currently live in Jakarta, I’ll put a local example here. Say you want to go to Changi International Airport in Singapore, departing from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta using your trusty vehicle and its fuel. We can say that going to Changi Airport is your goal, and the process before you arrive—fuel management, fare management, etc.—is your system.

If you rely solely on your own system, you are like a driver trying to reach Soekarno-Hatta Airport. Your "system" is your discipline: checking the traffic apps, filling the gas tank, and leaving early to manage the fare and the schedule. But no matter how disciplined you are, you are still on the ground. You are still subject to the chaos of Jakarta traffic. If a truck breaks down on the toll road, your perfect system stalls. You might still make it, but it might not be enjoyable and can take longer than you think.

See where I’m going? **What if your system is God?**

Suddenly, you aren't fighting traffic in a car, but you are in a helicopter. The obstacles that stop everyone else—the traffic jams, the roadblocks, the detours—do not apply to you because you are operating on a higher plane.

When God is the system, you don't just reach the airport faster, you might bypass the commercial flight entirely. While others are queuing at immigration, you are being airlifted directly to a destination better than the one you planned, perhaps a place you didn't even know existed (which strengthens the point that goals are merely a direction). The point is, you can go anywhere you want, and it can be assured since the one backing you up is the most powerful being that exists.

Who knows what the next 1, 5, or 10 years will become? **God might.**
